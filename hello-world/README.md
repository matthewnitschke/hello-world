# TWRA - Hello World

> "Write a function that displays: 'Hello World!'

We are engineers, not authors. So why have the engineers write the text "Hello World"? We should leave that to the true professionals.

`run.py` takes a picture of a book and uses an OCR library to retrieve text. The program will splice together the words in the image to create a "Hello World" image.
